\arguments{
\item{counts}{data.frame; A data frame with counts data with gene names as
rownames and sample names as colnames.}

\item{mincount}{numeric; A minimum colSum for which columns with a higher
colSum will be detected. Default = 4e5.}

\item{geneName}{character; The gene name to use for the quantile cutoff. This
must be present in the rownames of the counts argument. Default is ACTB.}

\item{quantile.cut}{numeric; This indicates probability at which the quantile
cutoff will be calculated using the normal distribution. Default = 0.01.}
}
\value{
A logical vector with length = ncol(counts) that is TRUE when the
counts data.frame column contains a sample with colSums > mincount.
}
\description{
It is often the case that some samples from sequencing experiments are of
low quality, in many cases due to issues during the sample preperation stage.
Due to the fact that these samples represent a high level of technical noise,
it is often desirable to remove these before downstream analysis which is
facilitated by this function. The function achieves this using two methods.
First, the mincount argument detects samples whose sum across all genes is >
mincount. Second, we utilize a house keeping gene and assume its expression
to be normally distributed. We then detect samples where the probability of
the expression for the house keeping gene in that sample is greater than the
quantile.cut argument.

x <- runif(2e4)
y <- runif(2e4, 1, 100)
names <- paste0(letters, 1:2e4)
counts <- data.frame(a = x, b = y, c = y, row.names = names)
